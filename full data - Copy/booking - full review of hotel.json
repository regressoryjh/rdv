One of the most enjoyable stays we've had in our travels.\nThe buildings, decor and furnishings are all in the art deco style even down to the 1940's music that plays in the background creating a wonderful atmosphere. Surrounding each of the buildings is a beautifully maintained garden with many specimen plants.\nGreat location, close to many of the tourist sites.\nOur room was clean, well maintained with a comfortable bed. The water purifier, cooler/heater outside the room was a very nice touch meaning ice cold water or hot coffee/tea was there whenever we wanted it.\nThe staff at the hotel were some of the friendliest and most helpful we've come across.\nA good breakfast is served as well as meals available throughout the day, all of good quality.\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our four night stay and would happily return and recommend the Ceria Hotel to others.",

The water pressure was great , there's hot water for shower. Distance from hotel to Jalan Malioboro was quite close. Probably 10 mins walk. Nearby a street selling gudeg!

Non accettano la carta di credito a differenza di quanto scritto su booking e, non avendo abbastanza contanti con me, ho dovuto discutere mezz'ora con il ragazzo alla reception (che non parlava inglese ma usava il traduttore) perché non voleva darmi la camera anche se era mezzanotte ed ero sola con mio figlio che non stava più in piedi dal sonno. Ho anche proposto di pagare almeno la prima notte ma non voleva saperne. Alla fine alzando la voce mi ha lasciato la camera che ho puntualmente saldato la mattina dopo prelevando quello che serviva.",

Llegamos temprano y nos dijeron que no tenían habitación disponible, después nos dijeron que sí pero que había que pagar..Nos dieron un importe y cuando fuimos a pagarlo, lo subieron, trataron de explicar  que era porque no se podía pagar con tarjeta... pagamos lo que pidieron porque yo me encontraba mal pero no me pareció correcto.",

La habitación no estaba limpia y tenia telarañas, les pedi que me limpiaran la habitación un poco mejor y para mi sorpresa pasaron una fregona por el suelo y la ducha y limpiaron una de las telarañas que les enseñé para hacer el amago. Lamentable. Supuestamente teníamos desayuno el cual no vimos. La entrada era compartida con algo que parecía una tienda y no hablan apenas inglés. No volvería",

  "likedText": "The best hostel I’ve ever stayed at – and I’ve stayed at many!\r\n\r\nI’ve traveled a lot in my life – through Latin America, Europe, and Asia, often on long-term trips. I’ve seen countless hostels along the way, but Nooze Hostel has been by far the best I’ve ever stayed in – for several reasons.\r\n\r\nFirst of all, the building itself is simply beautiful: welcoming, cozy, and exceptionally well-designed, with so many thoughtful little details. What I especially loved is the natural sunlight that fills the space – it creates such a warm and calming atmosphere. And despite being in the heart of Yogyakarta, it’s wonderfully quiet, tucked away in a small side street with no traffic noise at all.\r\n\r\nThe location is perfect: just a short walk to the city’s main attractions – the Palace, the Water Castle, and the most famous museums. Even the lively Malioboro Street is only a few minutes away, but you’re not right in the middle of the hustle.\r\n\r\nBut what truly sets Nooze apart is the team. It was hands down the most attentive, friendly, and helpful staff I’ve ever experienced in a hostel. They took the time to help me with personalized recommendations – not just generic tips, but advice based on what I was actually interested in. They also supported me with booking transport and anything else I needed for my journey. On top of that, they were always up for a warm chat – always smiling.\r\n\r\nI really hope the owner knows what a strong team she/he has. And even though I didn’t meet her/him personally, it’s obvious that someone put a lot of heart and care into creating a truly exceptional experience. The level of detail is just incredible.\r\n\r\nI’ll definitely be coming back – and I can recommend Nooze Hostel from the bottom of my heart.",

We&#39;re so happy to hear that you had a great experience during your stay with us. It truly means a lot to our entire team to know that you found the hostel well arranged, clean, and welcoming.\n\nWe’re especially glad that you enjoyed our breakfast and laundry service, and that you found some good spots to relax and chill around the property. Also, thank you for the kind words about our staff, it’s always our pleasure to help with recommendations and tips to make your Yogyakarta adventure even more special.\n\nAs for the room temperature, thank you for understanding. While the room you booked doesn’t include air conditioning, we do have several other room types available that are equipped with AC for extra comfort, so if you decide to stay with us again (and we really hope you do!), we’d be happy to help you choose one that suits your preferences best.\n\nWe also appreciate your note about the bathroom sink. We know that sharing facilities can get a little busy at peak times, and we&#39;re currently looking at ways to improve the space and flow in our shared areas. Your feedback is super helpful and helps us grow!\n\nThanks again for staying with us and for spreading such good vibes. Wishing you all the best on your travels, and we hope to welcome you back soon for another warm and memorable stay!\n\nWarmest regards,\nDida and Snooze Team",

We got some coffee and a hostel tour. During the tour someone else brought our heavy backpacks to our rooms. \n\nInside the hostel they have amazing breakfast with fresh fruit, which is being made for you by their chef. They also make their own ice cubes so no worries about that while ordering an ice coffee. Everything is so clean; the rooms, toilet, shower (which is cold but we loved it after a hot day), kitchen and living room. They even have an amazing jungle garden. \n\nAll the girls are so personal and love to make a chit chat with you. After a day in Yogyakarta coming back in the hostel feels like coming home again. “How was your day, did you enjoyed it, what did you do? Do you want some coffee?” Loved that! \n\nBesides this we got to travel with the hostel driver: Imam. He drove us to Borobudur and Prambanan. It was an amazing day, Imam is amazing. We learned and laughed a lot with him. After the day he felt like a good friend. Would recommend everyone to drive with Imam for the day. Ask the reception if he is available and you will have a lovely day.",

Our team works hard behind the scenes to keep everything fresh and cozy, and it’s so rewarding to hear it made a difference in your stay.\n\nOur little jungle garden is a favorite spot of ours too, perfect for a peaceful coffee or just relaxing after a day of adventures. And we absolutely love hearing that you enjoyed the casual chats and warm check-ins from our team at the front desk. We&#39;re genuinely enjoy connecting with our guests, and we’re glad it made you feel cared for and at home. \n\nAnd of course… Imam! What can we say? He’s truly one of a kind and he&#39;s the favourite among us too. It makes us so happy to know your trip to Borobudur and Prambanan with him was not only smooth and fun, but meaningful too. He really does have a way of making people feel at ease, sharing stories, and turning a day trip into a special memory. We&#39;ll make sure he reads your sweet words, he&#39;ll be so touched!\n\nThank you again for taking the time to share your experience in such detail, it’s guests like you that make what we do so rewarding. We already miss you around here, and we hope one day you’ll come back and stay with us again. There will always be a warm welcome (and coffee!) waiting for you.\n\nWarm Regards,\nDida and Snooze Team",

They even prepared a booklet with all usefull information about city’s atractions.\n\nArea is clean and quiet (for us is no problem with calling for a prayer), but super close to the center, museums, shops and restaurants - so You can enjoy the city by 5-10min walk. Yogya has nice artistic vibe and everywhere grows green plants.\nBreakfast is included - You can appreciate the art during the eating :) Room is comfortable and very clean, with WIFI.\nIt’s easy to get there by cheap train or take a Grab Taxi from the AirPort.

They’re so friendly and helpful - we had a lovely time staying in their guesthouse. \n\nThey have had a hot shower system installed recently which is really good! \n\nAll of the breakfasts they offer are so delicious - we will truly miss the egg sandwiches and Indonesian rice and noodles they made for us! Breakfasts always included fruit, cold water and coffee too. In the mini kitchen, you can boil water at any time and there’s a free water refill too.\n\nThe guesthouse is very convenient for local sites and is in a quiet (if you’re a light sleeper, the hosts provide ear plugs too) and peaceful location. We thought the room was very cute and well decorated. \n\nHighly recommend for a stay in Yogyakarta!",

You can also rent bikes from them directly. The staff were very nice and super helpful - we had some issues figuring out where to get the bus from to our next destination and they helped us contact the right people and get the information for us.

  "dislikedText": "I felt like I was an inconvenience. Some of the staff was extremely unwelcoming. One guy specifically (who was working all 3 days we were there) wouldn’t even acknowledge us and just stared at his phone when we had questions or needed help. The walls are paper thin so you can hear everything outside and in the rooms next door. We didn’t use the kitchen much but there was open food leftover and no free coffee like the ad said. Looks like maybe it used to be a popular spot but wasn’t many people staying there so lacked a social atmosphere, yeah just not my favorite place..",

Room 505 was clean, the hot water worked without any issues, and the air conditioning functioned perfectly — which is especially important in this region. Breakfast was very good, mostly catering to Asian tastes, which is understandable. The coffee was excellent! The staff deserve special mention: friendly, helpful, and truly a 10/10.",
  "dislikedText": "Cleaning seemed a bit superficial — corners, edges, and the tops of wardrobes didn’t appear to be thoroughly cleaned. Maybe I’m a bit picky, but I believe many European guests notice these details. There was no separate hand soap, just a wall-mounted dispenser in the shower, which felt inconvenient. The shower itself could use renovation: the water pressure was weak, the shower head kept moving, and the curtain was too short and should be replaced. The windows weren’t sealed properly and should be improved.",

We often chatted about the places I should see in the city and they gave me good recommendations. Owner Yos helped me a lot to rent a motorbike and even took me to places that provide motorbike rental services with his own motorbike. Yos is a very good man. The hostel was very clean, you can use the kitchen, the internet is good and there are many places to eat locally and markets in the area. There is also a seating area in the garden and beautiful fish you can watch :)",

  "propertyResponse": "Hi Angie, I’m glad you chose to stay with Bukit Vista. Thank you for writing this review, it means a lot for us. \n\nI’m sorry to hear that you are unhappy with some of our services during your stay. We have checked the floor as you mentioned, and we agreed that it needs deep cleaning like we did from time to time. The parking fee is out of our control since it’s a public parking, but we think this is important to have accurate  information for guests. \n\nI do understand that people have different levels of expectations, but to give guests unpleasant experience is unacceptable and we are committed to fix this issue. \n\nWe’ve done property-wide deep cleaning to ensure best experience for our future guests. And we have a dedicated person that will be standing by waiting for guest check in, even in the middle of the night. We are now offering to cover the parking fee for 1 car for our guest and updated the information.\n\nAs our commitment, we are giving you a refund of Rp 300,000,- to cover the parking fee that you paid. \n\nWe are happy to host you and hoping you would stay with us again in the future. \n- Bukit Vista Joglo Kawung",

The location of this property is an absolute value: right in the middle of the city and only steps away from one of the main attractions, Malioboro Street. Staff were friendly and efficient; They allowed us to check in early as we got to Jogja way before check-in time. We love the hotel's rooftop: we had brunch while we waited for our room and an evening drink later at sunset. The food at the rooftop bar was delicious, and the view was pretty amazing. The staff at the rooftop bar was friendly and attentive, always ensuring we had all we needed. The room was clean and functional. The view of the city from our room was nice. As somebody who grew up in Jogja, I felt a lovely nostalgia to see a familiar view from the room. The following day, it was an easy walk too to get to the train station and catch our airport train to YIA.",

Royal palace and water castle are 5-10 minutes away by Andong (horse carriage) or Becak (motorised rickshaw).\r\n\r\nStaff are friendly and helpful, but I guess it applies to the locals. People are always smiling and courteous. \r\n\r\nBig comfortable room.\r\n\r\nNice rooftop swimming pool.\r\n\r\nFree parking at the basement.",

Note, I requested a room without a view to get some sleep (can't hear prayer call) - which was fine if all the room is used for is sleeping. Great stay!",

We’re glad to hear that you found our location, staff, and facilities to your liking.\n\nI apologize for the inconvenience you experienced with the room size and the bathroom door lock. Our standard room is designed to accommodate 2 adults and 2 children under 12 years old with existing bedding, which might sometimes feel a bit snug for a family of four. We understand that this can affect your comfort and regret that it fell short of your expectations.\n\nTo enhance your experience on future stays, we offer larger room options for an additional charge. Our Deluxe Room, which is 34 sqm, or the Executive Room at 40 sqm, could provide the extra space and comfort that might be more suitable for your family. If you decide to visit us again, please let us know if you would like to explore these upgrade options.\n\nWe truly appreciate your feedback as it helps us improve our services. Thank you once again for choosing our hotel. We look forward to the opportunity to welcome you and your family back and to provide a more comfortable stay.\n\nBest regards,\nFitria A.\nFront Office Manager",

  "likedText": "This hotel is in a good location, within 8 minutes of a Grab ride to the main (and loud) Malioboro area . It's in a quieter area with some cafes and local eateries around which you have to wander around the quaint gangs to find. Staff speak.good English and are always eager to please. The room is good sized and very comfortable. Breakfast buffet has a good selection but I'd prefer the food to be piping hot so maybe go slightly later for the burners to get into full swing. Otherwise I'd give it top marks!",

Arriving at Prima In we were disgusted at the mould growing up the walls, the peeling wallpaper, the bed sheets covered in stains. There was a strong damp smell and just general dirt and stains everywhere. Whilst we moved rooms, the second one wasn’t much better but we were too tired to move again.\nThe bed was hard and we were only given 1 pillow each. When I asked for another pillow, they tried to charge me 30,000 per night. \nThe walls are paper thin so you can hear everything. Your neighbours, down the corridor, floors above and below, outside etc. We were woken at 5 every morning by the call to prayer, then by kids in the pool at 6am (we were on floor 5). \nThe room facilities were poor. The plug sockets and light switches were coming away at the wall. We had a broken lamp that we reported that was not replaced. No soap is provided in the bathroom and we had to ask for When we ate in the restaurant for dinner one night, the chicken I ate was not properly cooked and made me unwell. \nLocation wise, you are close to Malioboro street, but not too close that you can hear it through the night. There are a lack of restaurants immediately nearby - you have to walk to Malioboro for this. You are also not close enough to walk to the palaces, we’d recommend staying further that way and absolutely avoiding this hotel.",

We could not even get past the many many many people in the dining area eating their meal after fasting all day to get to the lift to our room. If hotel fully booked for Ramadan dinners then they should not take bookings for tourists or advise that this is the case. Breakfast was also left overs as all the people eating for Ramadan also were up early to eat. Me as a westerner had eggs only. The actual room was clean though very very small. No room for suitcases etc. extremely disappointed . I cannot believe the so called reviews were genuine. I will never recommend this hotel for non locals.",

  "likedText": "Great place! You're not going to get a lower priced place to stay right in the centre (7 mins walk to the main shopping street). It's a very basic room, but if you're like me and can sleep anywhere and don't mind the occasional mosquito, etc, then this is great for you.\n\n Also, it's right in the middle of an awesome little village, with such kind-hearted people who I met and spoke to everyday. It's a really safe and friendly neighborhood there. If you want a more authentic experience rather than staying in a city hotel, this is the better choice, especially for the price. Udi is an amazing guy too, making me coffee and fried banana every morning, also doing me other favours!\n\nYou're also right next to so many street shops and food, which are so cheap! I rented a scooter during my stay and it was so cool driving down and seeing the little side streets that lead to this homestay. The kids would always stop me to greet and say hello\n\nI also enjoyed having the cats around, they're really friendly",

The room was filthy, with mould on the bathroom ceiling, dusty surfaces, and an overpowering artificial fragrance clearly masking the lack of proper cleaning. When I complained, the front desk manager was shockingly unprofessional and dismissive, even mocking my concerns.\n\nThey showed us an alternative room with yellow, dirty walls and promised to repaint it. The result? A room reeking of fresh paint fumes, which they expected us to accept. The conditions were not just unpleasant but outright unhealthy, and the front desk manager’s attitude made everything worse.\n\nAs my complaints were ignored, I contacted Booking.com for help, and while they managed to settle a compensation, the hotel management retaliated by demanding we check out at 11 PM - something I’ve never experienced before!

We hope to welcome you and your family back for an even better stay in the future.\n\nBest regards,\nAveta Hotel Malioboro Management",

Regarding the weekend road closures, we would like to explain that these are part of the local government’s efforts to manage traffic flow and reduce congestion in the Malioboro area. While it may cause some temporary inconvenience, it’s meant to benefit the overall traffic situation in the long run.\n\nWe apologize for the issue with the bed setup and will make sure to provide clearer details about room configurations in the future. Additionally, the charge for extra towels is a part of our hotel’s policy, which may vary from other establishments, and special requests are granted based on availability.\n\nWe look forward to your next visit and hope to offer a more seamless experience.\n\nBest regards,\nAveta Hotel Malioboro Management",

  "likedText": "Perfect for 2 to 4 people. The tiny garden was my favourite place in the whole house. Its very nice if you want to drink your morning coffee with a view. The rooms were spacious and comfortable. One of the bedrooms and the dining cum kitchen overlooked the garden. Very good architectural design so as to maximise use of natural sunlight. Loved the coloured glass panes at the entrance. It was perfect for me and my mother and very close to the kings palace and mailoboro street. Overall, was a little bit of home away from home. Ario, the caretaker was really helpful and available at all hours of he day, ever ready to help. I will definitely come back again since you can also cook your own Food.",
  "dislikedText": "There Was tea coffee and sugar however, Would be great if some salt could be provided because we found it a bit difficult to buy small portions of salt. Ario helped us with a suggestion and only then we found it. The drawing cum kitchen room could use a stronger fan..",

Just under an hour away from Prambanan and/or Ratu Boko by vehicle.\nPretty good microsite outlining how to get to attractions, local eating spots, etc.\nKitchen facilities, which were nice, since other places I've stayed at in Indonesia haven't had kitchens. Plus a supermarket a couple of streets away.\nGood sized lockers under beds in the room, too.",

  "propertyResponse": "Thanks for sharing your thoughts, Sharma! We'll definitely consider adding a note to our booking process about early arrivals, so guests can plan accordingly. We understand that arriving at 6am morning and waiting for the previous guests to check out can be a bit of a challenge. It's always best to book check in 10April, when you are arriving 6am on 11April. Self check in access code do available 24H. We'll make sure to communicate our check-in&out policies more clearly to avoid any inconvenience in the future. Regarding the motorbike, we appreciate your feedback on our rental policies. We have reviewed our rental procedures, it was fair and transparent. Thanks again for your input, and we hope you enjoyed Yogyakarta.",

And if not, the people here wil take care of it for you! \n\nOur shower did not work properly after a couple of minutes and we immediately got an upgrade to an even bigger room for 1 week while they took care of preparing the shower.\n\nIt was such a good place to stay, I recommend it to everyone!! ❤️",

We appreciated the flowers and preparations for our honeymoon. Privacy and tranquillity is also important - maybe more isolation measures or rules in the hotel could be an option to make guests stay more pleasant.",
  "dislikedText": "Size of room (very small compared with photos); food might take into consideration peoples tastes and allergies. Position of room and lack of privacy",

They provide free coffee/tea facilities but I don't think they ever washed the cups! The alun-alun was rather disappointing and the guest house is far from main road. You need to have Grab app. No taxis around at all. We only stayed 2 of 3 nights booked, we just had to get out of there. We stayed 2 nights only because on the 2nd day we had whole day tour booked starting at 4am, so had no time to move places. Definitely would not go back there! I am disappointed that booking.com is promoting this place at all!",

She also recommended a tour agency for Borobodur and a local restaurant that was sooo yummy and cheap.

Restaurant raussuchen und hinlaufen - wie wir Deutschen das gerne machen - war nicht möglich. Macht da aber auch keiner und Grab hat uns gut gefahren. Alles in Allem Jammern auf hohem Niveau. Griya Yunika ist absolut empfehlenswert - auch für Europäer.",

The best part is kid not allowed in this homestay, very nice for those travelling solo that dont like kids screaming or crying while resting :)",

This surprised us because we expected a warm and open atmosphere based on the good reviews. The other (few) guests seemed to be local long-term guests who were not really interested in interacting with us backpackers. Rather, we had the impression that we were only being tolerated, which is why we stayed in our room most of the time. The outdoor area was neglected which was also disappointing.",

From the moment I arrived, I was greeted by a very low-light space, a receptionist who barely spoke 2 words of English, and was given a room that had a musty smell, mold, and humidity spots all over the walls. The paint was chipping from the walls, ants were crawling everywhere, the bedding was in several off-white colors that smelled, and of course, the bathroom had a moldy floor, no soap, no paper, and a broken flush that kept me awake the nights I stayed. Now I immediately contacted booking.com with evidence to claim that there were concerns in this property and the accommodation itself, to maybe work things out; however, after the property asked me what they could do, and I responded, they ghosted me. For 25 days straight, after I messaged the property almost every day, they never got back to me even once. Booking.com wasn't even helpful in mediating, as they kept pushing me to get a written confirmation from the property for a refund of my money, when the property just ignored all forms of communication. I am very disappointed at this for obvious reasons, especially as someone who thought the platform would protect me in case anything happened, now, I'm at a financial loss as I had to book elsewhere for my long trip in Indonesia, and there are no indications of a possible refund for now.",

When they finally agreed to replaced the sheets, we found the duvet to be bloodstained and the pillows were mouldy. The staff insisted they couldn't be switched because all were like this. They said it waa thereason they used pillowcases.\n\nThe new sheets we were given had fresh blood on them - obviously no concern about safety.\n\nThe staff was appalling. The only way to communicate was via translate, and they simply did not care that the hotel waa unfit for habitation. They also smoked in the hallways, despite the \"no smoking\" sign next to their heads.\n\nDO NOT be fooled by the pictures on this site. They bear no resemblance to reality.

I like the overall house setting, the outdoor area is super cute and it feels homey. The host handled our complaint very well. The AC in the second bedroom was not working and the host was very helpful. They sent an AC technician to fix the problem. Then, we found out it could not be fixed straight away so the host helped us to get an alternative hotel for the second bedroom's guests.",
  "dislikedText": "No parking, it was inconvenient having to pay extra to leave the car. If I may suggest it could be better to include the parking in the price of the stay. Secondly, the bathroom. You have to walk through the main bedroom if you need to go to the bathroom. Even though there was a toilet downstairs, it hardly got used as it was all the way downstairs and the squatting toilet was not suitable for my elderly parents who stayed in the second bedroom.",

For one duvet should be 425.000 rupiah. They said can’t remove the dirty one, I was just like wtf it’s can remove. Without checking properly they easily say I need pay for that. Of course I’m not just saying ok. I told them the dirty duvet is only one and can washed. So in the end I only pay 250.000 rupiah after the other stuff check again the room. I understood for the trouble my kid made, but to be honest this is the first time I had this experience. I been in so many hotel for my family holiday, but this hotel is really annoyed me because it’s ridiculous when one stuff came to the room and asked me about the dirty duvet he said 2 duvets dirty and I said come in check again it’s only one and can remove, then he said oh ok only one but without looking 🤣 and I said if it’s really can’t washed it I can pay full 425.000 rupiah but give me the duvet and he said ok. When I checked out, they check again they said only one dirty and can wash it but I should pay 250.000 rupiah for the treatment 🤣",

I got 6 bottle of meniral water but on the second day, they forgot to refill. The bathroom is not too big, but its okay. Breakfast not so vary but enough.\nLocation is very strategic, very near to the train station and malioboro street. Easy to find something to eat near the hotel, private laundry services also nearby.",
  "dislikedText": "The soap provided in the bathroom was few and difficult to pump. Narrow parking lot. When closing the door you must push it very hard otherwise its still unlocked and others can easily enter you room, eventhough the door make sounds when you did not close it properly, most of the guests did not realize it .I keep hearing those noises in the middle of the night. Suggest to the hotel staff to remind the guests if the door make some noise which mean they did not close the door properly.\nYou can easily go to the each room floor, and the lift can take us to the floor we want to go without scanning our room key which I think the hotel management should think the safety of the guests with this condition.",

  "dislikedText": "I left my luggage with a hotel luggage tag in the security room before check in. When I was back, the hotel kept saying me that they will bring the luggage to my room, but after several questions when it will be, they never brought it. This is how I found out that they didn’t have one of my bags anymore, it was my backpack that had my work laptop and and my documents that was missing. I had to stay hours looking at security cameras to see what happened. In the end I saw  that they gave my backpack to another person, I don’t know if it was intentionally or unintentionally. It took many hours to find out everything and get my stuff back (the driver that supposedly had my backpack all day, returned it only after we called him). The hotel stuff was rude and unwilling to say what was going on most of the time, they were refusing to call the police for a long time. There was only  one person who seemed to try to help more genuinely. I couldn’t work (I planned to work all day  from this hotel) and got in trouble at work because of this. I still had to pay the full price of the hotel room, although I couldn’t use any of its services between looking at my stuff and going to the police station. \r\nAt the police station the personal of the hotel were with me, and after I filed the report I saw how they were giving money to the policeman. When I asked why they did it, they said it was for coffee.\r\nTerrible experience, never went through something like this before.",

  "likedText": "Great location, everybody was nice, there's hot water and cold water from a shared pantry area. The place is super cute. The rooms are arranged like little houses around the shared pantry area, so there's an outdoor feel.\n\nIt's walkable to the Kraton, Malioboro, lots of cafes and food places around. As a solo female traveller it feels safe. It's in like a kampong vibe neighbourhood and I felt safe walking around the area on my own at night looking for food etc.\n\nBed is comfortable and air-conditioning is good. TV has Netflix. You get breakfast which is good, it's like the kind of meal you get from a school event: rice, protein, vegetables and a snack.",

Titik nol is about 25 minutes walk. \n\nSuch a lovely host. I was served local food in the morning while I was sitting at the kitchenette having my usual breakfast I've bought myself prior to arriving (muesli, yoghurt and banana) and coffee (provided by the host). She gave me little snackettes for several days..bananas..fritters..currypuff..nasi Gudek.. Although, breakfast is not included in the booking.\n\nIm soo grateful. Thank you for being a superb host!",

The only downside is the mosque that wakes you up around 4:45 AM despite using wax earplugs — it lasts about 10 minutes, but that’s common everywhere in Yogyakarta. The location is 12 minutes from Malioboro by Grab, in a cozy side street. The cameras and gate also make you feel safe.",

The pool area looked inviting, even though we didn’t get the chance to use it during our stay. The staff were exceptionally kind and accommodating. As we had to leave early before breakfast, they went the extra mile to prepare a takeaway meal for us. A great touch of hospitality!",
  "dislikedText": "We encountered some ants on our blankets, so we decided to remove them from the room for the night. The air conditioning worked fine, but due to the small size of the room, it cooled down very quickly. However, once the AC was turned off, the room became hot and humid. Perhaps with the blankets, it would have been more comfortable.\n\nThe biggest challenge we faced was the early morning prayer at 4 a.m., which was extremely loud and lasted quite a while (the last one we heard ended about 40 minutes later). While this is likely the case for most city center locations, it can be difficult to sleep through if you’re not accustomed to it. Even earplugs might not block out the sound entirely. It’s something to consider if you’re sensitive to noise or value uninterrupted sleep.",

We really appreciate it, it means a lot to us as we are a small business. \n\nWe are happy to hear you did enjoy your stay at our accommodation.\nWe are sorry you didn’t find the button to switch on/ off the jet and bubbles of the jacuzzi, those are located under the stair. The jacuzzi did work and still does☺️🙏\n\nRegarding the shopkeepers next to the accommodation, they are a part of our staff.\nAnd again we are sorry as owners for not being able to greet you on the location in person. We are still continuing to improve our services. \nWe hope when you come back to Yogyakarta again , then we have more employees to greet and help you in person ☺️🙏\n\nHave a good day.\n\nKind regards,\nSastro Place team",

This was something weird as I did not smell anything when the bathroom door is closed, but she did. Additionally, she said that the smell went away in the morning, which is even weirder. \r\n\r\nBesides the bathroom smell, the room is quite old with many stains on the wall. The bed and bedsheet of our room was also quite dirty, and we had to request for a change of the sheets. You can definitely find a much better place to stay for the same price.",

Breakfast on the first day was a set menu without asking for dietary restrictions beforehand, so please be aware of that. There was no duvet cover which is unusual. Cleaning could be better as we found several hairs right after arrival. The message about only accepting married couples should be made clear before you book (without cancellation option), even though nobody asked about it at check-in.",

You can refill water and help yourself with free tee & coffee. Joni helped me a lot with planing my adventures. Yes the showers are cold but as you never really get that cold in indonesia, its really refreshing & not that cold. He and his wife made me feel home & welcome. Don't forget to check out the rooftop terracce. Recommand this place and would come back any time. 🫶😊",

  "likedText": "The room was clean, and the balcony was nice to have! Private bathroom and air conditioning. Like most places in Indonesia, the shower only has cold water, which is refreshing after a hot day!\nI highly recommend paying the small fee daily for breakfast! Let them know your choice and time in the morning, and he will have it ready on the rooftop dining table! You have a choice of fried rice with egg, fried noodles with egg, egg on toast, or  their famous banana pancake! (One whole banana wrap in a crepe with chocolate drizzle) \n\nThe owner also offers a very clean, comfortable private car to all the attractions at a fair price.\n\nThe owners are very kind and helpful. The hotel is small with 12 rooms and a shared rooftop. It is located in a small alley with a lot of little restaurants. Alley way is very quiet, and no scooters are allowed to drive in alley. The hotel is a 5-minute walk from the train station. (Alley is right across from the station). It is also only a 5-minute walk to Maliboro Street with tones of shopping!\n\nOur host went above and beyond when our train was canceled due to an accident and walked us personally to the train station to help us secure another other arrangement. \n\nWe would deffinatly stay again and totally recommend this place, thank you!",

También nos dejaron dejar las mochilas durante el día (bien!), pero en la entrada del alojamiento porque ellos estaban ahí 24h, decían, cuando fuimos por la tarde no había nadie y tardó en volver casi 2 horas, así que nos quedamos nosotros revisando las mochilas.

We read this and we live in a city, so we thought it would be fine, but it's insanely loud, we couldn't even have a conversation at some points as we couldn't hear each other. Plus the bed situation, it did say twin beds, so again we knew, but I didn't expect the second bed to be just a pull out mattress. Shower was good, but hot water tank was very small, you have to be super quick, washing hair as fast as possible otherwise hot water runs out, and there definitely not enough water for 2 showers back to back, so we had to plan shower time haha.",

As the first person we met at the hotel, she failed to make us feel welcome and made the rest of the stay unpleasant.\n\nInformation provided in booking.com was not accurate. It said the extra bed cost IDR 150k, in reality they charge 250k. The receptionist was defensive, eventhough I show her the price shown in the app for 150k. She asked me to call Booking.com but she cannot help me with the number. I did make a reservation for an extra bed in the app. Again, she choosed not to belive me. \n\nThe junior suit was a bit dark due to lack of lighting and no window (1 fake window). The airco was  really noisy. \n\nI choose the hotel because they have a lift for my elderly parents with heart condition, but in reality the lift can be accessed after climbing some stairs. This hotel is not diffable friendly eventhough they have a lift.",

  "propertyResponse": "Good morning everyone,\n\nWe understand that bedbug issues can occur in any hotel at any time. As a hotel, we take such complaints seriously and always carry out thorough sterilization procedures immediately if there is any report of bedbugs in one of our rooms. This is the most responsible action we can take in such situations.\n\nIt&#39;s important to note that bedbugs can appear suddenly, often brought in by travelers via backpacks or suitcases from other places. These items can serve as mediums for cross-contamination, allowing bedbugs to spread unknowingly from one location to another.\n\nIn the recent case where a guest complained about bedbugs in their room, we immediately offered to move them to a different room. However, the guest refused this option and instead became upset, insisting on a refund for the next two nights of their stay.\n\nFollowing this, our staff conducted a full inspection, dismantling the bed and mattress, but we did not find any signs of bedbugs. Based on this, we suspect the guest may have already found another hotel more aligned with their preferences and created the bedbug story in an attempt to get a refund.\n\nWe would also like to highlight that although the guest initially complained about bedbugs, they also began raising unrelated issues, including complaints about our swimming pool. This further reinforces our belief that their intention may have been to leave and seek a refund, rather than address a genuine issue.\n\nThis situation has caused us considerable distress, especially as we strive to be transparent by clearly listing room sizes, amenities, and photographs for every room type on platforms like Booking.com. We are committed to providing a clean, comfortable environment for all our guests and take all feedback seriously. However, we also believe it&#39;s important to protect ourselves from unjust claims that can harm our reputation.\n\nThank you for your understanding.\n\nBest regards,\n[Hotel Management]",

We got chicken rice bowl each morning. Comes with either Americano or tea. \n\nThe bed was big and comfy. \n\nThey have a water machine. \n\nWiFi was good. \n\nWater was hot in the shower. \n\nLocation was in town and had a car park.",
  "dislikedText": "Place is declining and needs some tlc. Had mold on bedroom ceiling. Shower was blocked and not draining. Black hairs in shower. \n\nBiggest downfall is the lack of soundproofing. You can hear everything. There is a school opposite and you can hear them start every morning at 7am. They scream over a microphone. Then they do sports out the front. There is also a mosque that you can hear from 4am. So bring ear plugs. \n\nBedroom has poor lighting.\n\nThe staff were very smiley and polite but they were not trained or didn't care enough maybe I don't know. But you would have breakfast or coffee in the morning and come back at 5pm and it still wasnt cleaned up. You asked them for restaurant recommendations and they just say a street name to go down. You ask for scooter rental and they suggest the most expensive place in Indonesia. A little more service wouldn't go a miss. \n\nAlso the breakfast comes with Americano. We asked to pay more and make it a latte. This wasn't possible. Only if we paid for a latte full price. Small thing but maybe it's staff training.",

Even if I choose the room with a fan, it was never too hot in it (they also have rooms with a/c if you need it)\r\n-Bathrooms: Really clean, no bad smell, good water pressure, one of the showers have hot water, and there is a good ratio bathroom/number of guests\r\n-Breakfast: DELICIOUS!! Everyday they serve something different, always so tasty and good size portions. They also care if you have allergies or preferences (Indonesian food or not)\r\n-Location: The homestay is located in a really quiet green street with lots of trees where it feels cooler than the rest of the city. The neighborhood is safe, and you are close to everything \r\n-Common areas: Spacious and clean, and there is a garden with tables to chill and drink your coffee :) \r\n-Owner: She is a really nice person, can help you by giving you any informations about things to see, activities to do, places to go, and how to get there!\r\n\r\nI really enjoyed my stay and would not hesitate to book again if I come back to Yogya!!",

When we needed anything , there was no delay by staff too respond to our requests. For instance we had required an iron board and an adaptor and these were delivered quite promptly to our room. The massage services at the hotel was also very good . There are various places to relax such as a cafe on the ground floor and the pool and restaurant at the top and second floor. Sunrises were beautiful against the backdrop of Mt Merapi. The hotel is just across from the train station and round the corner of Malioboro street . There are plenty of options to eat and shop including a mall along Malioboro street. It is easy to catch pedicabs from anywhere to get around to Kraton or there in the train or bus that you can catch to Prambanan temple.",

  "likedText": "Very high class hotel. The staff are fantastic, so kind and go out of their way to assist you. Rooms were spacious, nicely decorated and brightly lit, and a lovely elegant bathroom. Breakfast had lots of options, all of which were superb. A really vast range of choices. The dinner was also really excellent with a very good chef. The cafe attached to the hotel was great also, and we appreciated the complimentary tea in reception everyday. We went to the spa and that was good too. The hotel is amazing value for money, and in a good location. It is literally 2 minutes from the train station and a short walk to Malioboro street. All in all, an excellent hotel.",
  "dislikedText": "A few minor points. The egg station advertises poached eggs but I’m not sure they really know how to cook these. Also, we ate dinner in the hotel twice because we were tired after long day trips and the atmosphere could have been improved. The staff were setting up for breakfast so there were lots of sounds of cutlery being put away and floor sweeping/cleaning. We were a bit hurried to finish our food so they could pack up, even though we were not eating late (we went for dinner at about 6:30/7?). Maybe this was because there were no other diners. This didn’t create a relaxing dining experience, but felt like a rushed meal. This was a shame as the food was superb. But these are only very small points as the hotel was overall fantastic :)",

  "dislikedText": "Alojamiento en condiciones higiénicas pésimas: la primera noche, nada más llegar, nos dieron una habitación en el piso superior llena de cucarachas. Al comentarlo con el personal, nos dieron un spray para matarlas, pero lo que pasó es que empezaron a aparecer más y más. Nos tuvieron que cambiar de habitación... En esa no vimos cucarachas pero la habitación igualmente estaba sucia y olía muy fuerte a humedad. La pintura de las paredes se caía por todos lados debido a las humedades. Además, no habían vaciado las basuras. \r\n\r\nNinguna de las 2 habitaciones tenía ventanas, ojo con eso porque las imágenes son engañosas, por lo que era imposible ventilar la habitación.\r\n\r\nAdemás de todo esto, el último día vimos cenizas en el suelo de la habitación, que intuimos era de uno de los chicos del personal que entró cuando no estábamos, y NO a limpiar...\r\n\r\nEl personal no habla inglés. En 3 días no hubo limpieza de habitaciones, las toallas olían mal, etc.... UN HORROR. El peor alojamiento en el que he estado.",

The food was great and the family who runs the hotel were very friendly and helpful in every way.

Todo lo que se anuncia en Booking es mentira: no hay sábanas, solo una manta que daba asco, no había pila en el baño, no había papel higiénico ( le preguntamos al dueño por papel y nos dijo que nos compráramos en el minimarket de enfrente, lo cual me parece vergonzoso), había un agujero en la pared, de TV plana ni hablar aunque no es lo que más me importa de un alojamiento, el olor de la habitación como a producto químico insoportable y además el hombre iba fumando por ahí por lo que en la habitación se sumaba el olor a tabaco. No nos quedamos a dormir ni la primera noche del asco que daba, reservamos otro hotel y nos fuimos. Cuando salíamos a darle la llave, el hombre estaba tirado en el suelo en una especie de habitación al lado de la entrada y no hizo absolutamente nada cuando le dijimos que nos íbamos porque todo olía muy mal y no estaba en buenas condiciones, le dio completamente igual, total el ya había cobrado. Vamos a poner una reclamación a booking y exigir la devolución y que retiren ese alojamiento de la web porque no se merece estar anunciado de lo asqueroso que es todo. NO LO RESERVEIS!!!

For people who need more space with grup or family. This place is a very good place. \nFor sure, this is a guesthouse not a homestay that live with different people, this place you stay with your group or family. \n\nNear alun alun utara just walk 12 minutes and near pasar ngasem, 10 minutes walk. Near RS muhammadiyah just walking across the street about 100 meter away. \nI walk 20 minutes to Malioboro, taking the short cut. \nI revision the google map name for this place because its not easy to find by place name in gojek. \nI guess now you can search it by name, “Griya Hanna”.",
  "dislikedText": "The homestay has 2 men live inside the house, for my family that have 3 daughter with hijab, is not comfort. While we choose this place to have a place that can mingle like at home, we can release our hijab. We cant do it. Good thing that the owner response our matter, so the keys of the house gave to us and the staffs left the house. They back again when we checked out.",

We are used to noisy rooms, but the window is so thin that you got the feeling, that you are sitting on the sidewalk of a busy street. Also the mosque nearby sounds like the megaphone is located your room and they start off very early in the morning.

  "likedText": "Its an exceptional Hostel. One of the best ones I have been so far. Its small but you will feel like home. There is a beautiful garden inside where you can chill out  during your stay and in the afternoon. Room is very comfy with two beds and some basic furniture. There is hanger outside for your wet towels. Bathroom is clean and quite big. There was just one thing which was annoying and this the bathroom light switch, which will also automatically switch-on the noisy fan (it can wake up rest of the family members). Breakfast is tasty, I am sure you will enjoy it. The host and his wife are super friendly. They will help you with getting around and arranging driver for whole day, which can take you to Prambanan, Borobudur, Merapi mountain, Watterfalls, Mariboro street, Luwang Coffee etc. It was also our pleasure to talk with them about daily life in Yogya. Hostel is ver close to the Sultan Palace and Mariboro, so you can make it by walk. Would happily return again, because we felt like at home all the time.",

The villa is very interesting: the swimming pool is the first thing you see, and the living and dining areas are next to this (these areas are covered, but open air). This makes it a nice place to hang out- the pool is quite cool. The rooms are comfortable, with very comfortable beds, and the furniture and decorations of a good standard. The roof terrace is a bit open, but does give decent views over the city. The location is great, a few minutes from Malioboro.",
  "dislikedText": "The lack of walls is problematic, as the villa is right next to a busy road and a junction, with all of the traffic noise this means. And the traffic noise goes on all day, and all night. Sleeping is a real issue, as the windows are big and off practically no insulation from all the noise. Additionally, the curtains are light-coloured and let in a lot of light early in the morning. Add to this the call to prayer, and you understand that you won't sleep well.\r\n\r\nThe lack of walls can also mean that things get in: food left out may be eaten, and a bat came in and made a mess of some chairs and the floor.",

We left our bags for the day and wanted to pick them back on the night. When we arrived, no one was here and no one actually rushed to help us so we were literally stuck without our stuff for more than 25 minutes (which sounds like nothing, but still a problem when you’re expecting a train and no one warned you about the fact that no one could be here). Anyway, rest assured that your stuff are safe if you leave them for the day. Additionally, they did not provide any info on how to visit the temples around yogya.",

  "likedText": "In hotel industry hospitality distinguishes the good from the great, the inexpert from the professional. Checked in to 101 Style Malioboro and immediately impressed with the warm welcome, speed of checking in, modern design, nice room, comfy bed, fluffy pillows, and good bfast spread. Had a bit of technical glitches in the day that follows. The technician tried their best to rectify, profusely apologized for the minor problem. The receptions too tried their best to find me another available room. With the help of Bu Titta, the Manager on Duty, they (Bu Titta and her team) came up with workable alternative solutions. Bu Titta waited beyond her working shift hours to ensure everything settled well. Our gratitude to the team. Please pass along my appreciation to Bu Titta, the technician, and receptionist teams as they have demonstrated sincere hospitality. They showed resilient at times of diversity. The hospitality makes us feel we were well taken care of. I would look for 101 Style accommodations the next time I am in Indonesia.",

  "propertyResponse": "Hi Tina,\n\nThank you so much for your wonderful review! We’re delighted to hear that you enjoyed our friendly staff, the breakfast selection, and our convenient location near Malioboro.\n\nI’m sorry to hear that the check-in process was slow, the pool was crowded, and one of the rooms didn’t have the best view. I also want to mention that the gym’s air conditioning can be adjusted by guests—it&#39;s located near the entrance, so feel free to turn it on whenever you need.\n\nYour comments are very valuable to us, and we will work on these issues to enhance our guest experience. We hope to have the opportunity to welcome you back for an even better stay in the future!\n\nBest regards,\nFitria A.\nFront Office Manager",
